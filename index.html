My research involves trying to understand the ecology and biology of Ediacaran macro-organisms using quantitative approaches.  Ediacaran macro-organisms are the oldest large, complex organisms in the fossil record, found 585-540 million years ago, just prior to the Cambrian explosion.   These Ediacaran organisms differ fundamentally from those found in any other time periods, making it difficult to resolve their basic biology such as their phylogenetic relationships or their ecology.  My approach is to utilise complex statistical techniques and theoretical models to quantitatively assess the feasibility of different biological or ecological properties such as reproductive mode or feeding strategy.
